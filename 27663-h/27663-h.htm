PREFACE.
</h2>
<p>
Whatever other excellence may be wanting in the ensuing
Poems, they are, with only nine exceptions out of the hundred,
strictly Sonnets. Those nine vary only from the rules of the
legitimate Sonnet in that they rhime <i>three</i>, instead of <i>four</i> times
in the <i>first</i> part. The pause is in <i>them</i>, as in the <i>rest</i>, variously
placed through the course of the verses; and thus they bear no
more resemblance than their associates, to those minute Elegies of
twelve alternate rhimes, closing with a couplet, which assume the
name of Sonnet, without any other resemblance to that order of
Verse, except their limitation to fourteen lines. I never found the
quadruple rhimes injurious to the general expression of the sense,
but in the excepted instances. When it is considered how few
they are in so <i>large</i> a number, I flatter myself the idea will vanish
that our language is not capable of doing justice to the <i>regular</i>
Sonnet.
</p>
<p>
From the Supplement to the Gentleman's Magazine for 1786,
I shall insert Mr. White's definition of the nature and perfection
<a name="preface4" /><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;iv]</span>
of this species of Verse, because I think it explains them with
justness and precision.
</p>
<p>
“Little Elegies, consisting of four stanzas and a couplet, are
no more Sonnets than they are Epic Poems. The Sonnet is of
a particular and <i>arbitrary</i> construction; it partakes of the nature
of Blank Verse, by the lines running into each other at
proper intervals. Each line of the first eight, rhimes four
times, and the order in which those rhimes should fall is decisive.
For the ensuing six there is more licence; they may,
or may not, at pleasure, close with a couplet.
</p>
<p>
“Of Milton's English Sonnets, only that to Oliver Cromwell
ends with a couplet, but the single instance is a sufficient precedent;
however, in three out of his five Italian ones, the
concluding lines rhime to each other.
</p>
<p>
“The style of the Sonnet should be nervous, and, where the
subject will with propriety bear elevation, sublime; with
which, simplicity of language is by no means incompatible.
If the subject is familiar and domestic, the style should,
though affectionate, be nervous; though plain, be energetic.
The great models of perfection, for the sublime and domestic
Sonnet, are those of Milton's, &lsquo;To the Soldier to spare his
Dwelling-place,&rsquo; and &lsquo;To Mr. Laurence.&rsquo;
<a name="preface5" /><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;v]</span>
</p>
<p>
“The Sonnet is certainly the most difficult species of poetic
composition; but difficulty, well subdued, is excellence.
Mrs. Smith says she has been told that the regular Sonnet
suits not the nature or genius of our language. Surely this
assertion cannot be demonstrated, and therefore was not worth
attention.
</p>
<p>
“Out of eighteen English Sonnets, written by Milton, four
are bad. The rest, though they are not free from certain
hardnesses, have a pathos and greatness in their simplicity,
sufficient to endear the legitimate Sonnet to every Reader of just
taste. They possess a <i>characteristic</i> grace, which can never
belong to three elegiac stanzas, closing with a couplet.”
</p>
<p>
I have pleasure in quoting the preceding Dissertation on the
<span class="smcap">Sonnet</span>, conscious that there is no order of Verse, upon which
so much erroneous opinion has gone forth, and of whose beauties
the merely common Reader is so insensible. But when the Author
of this just Treatise says of the assertion, that the legitimate
Sonnet suits not our language, “its truth cannot be demonstrated,”
he should perhaps rather have observed, that its fallacy
is proved by the great number of beautiful legitimate Sonnets,
which adorn our National Poetry, not only by Milton, but by
many of our <i>modern</i> Poets.
<a name="preface6" /><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</span>
</p>
<p>
Of the four of Milton's, justly disapproved by Mr. White,
there is one evidently a <i>burlesque</i>, written in sport. It begins,
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
“A book was writ of late, call'd Tetrachordon.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Doctor Johnson has the disingenuousness, in his Folio Dictionary,
under the word <span class="smcap">Sonnet</span>, to cite <i>that</i> Sonnet at full
length, as a specimen of Milton's style in this kind of Poetry.
Johnson disliked Sonnets, and he equally disliked Blank Verse,
and Odes. It is in vain to combat the prejudice of splenetic
aversion. The Sonnet is an highly valuable species of Verse;
the best vehicle for a single detached thought, an elevated, or a
tender sentiment, and for a succinct description. The compositions
of that order now before the Reader, ensued from time to
time, as various circumstances impressed the heart, or the imagination
of their Author, and as the aweful, or lovely scenes of
Nature, arrested, or allured her eye.

without making any exception, labors to prove, that the compositions of Dryden are

“If,” says he to the authors, “your Poets are still to be <i>Mr. Bayses</i>, and your

which it is their <i>true</i> interest to <i>support</i>. They persuade the credulous Many, with

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prose, or rhyme, confutes that plea.&mdash;The pain<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Friend's renown, that to his <i>own</i> must reign,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumed with dazzling hues of eloquence,<br />

<a name="footnote_19_1"></a><a href="#ref_19_1">1</a>: When Johnson's Idolaters are hard pressed concerning his injustice in those
<i>fallacious</i> though <i>able</i> pages;&mdash;when they are reminded that he there tells us the
perusal of Milton's Paradise Lost is a <i>task</i>, and never a <i>pleasure</i>;&mdash;reminded also
of his avowed contempt of that exquisite Poem, the <span class="smcap">Lycidas</span>;&mdash;of his declaration
that Dryden's absurd Ode on the death of Mrs. Anne Killegrew, written in
Cowley's <i>worst</i> manner, is the <i>noblest</i> Ode in this Language;&mdash;of his disdain of
<span class="smcap">Gray</span> as a <i>lyric</i> Poet; of the superior respect he pays to <i>Yalden</i>, <i>Blackmore</i>, and
<i>Pomfret</i>;&mdash;When these things are urged, his Adorers seek to acquit him of <i>wilful</i>
misrepresentation by alledging that he wanted ear for lyric numbers, and taste
for the <i>higher</i> graces of <span class="smcap">Poetry</span>:&mdash;but it is impossible so to believe, when we
recollect that even his <i>prose</i> abounds with poetic efflorescence, metaphoric conception,
and harmonious cadence, which in the highest degree adorn it, without
diminishing its strength. We must look for the source of his injustice in the
envy of his temper. When Garrick was named a Candidate for admission into
the Literary Club, Dr. Johnson told Mr. Thrale he would black-ball him. “<i>Who</i>,
Sir? Mr. Garrick! Companion of your Youth! your acknowledged Friend!”
“Why, Sir, I love my little David better than any, or all of his Flatterers love
him; but surely we ought to sit in a Society like ours, &lsquo;unelbow'd by a Gamester,
Pimp, or <span class="smcap">Player</span>.” See Supplement to Dr. Johnson's Letters, published
by Mrs. Piozzi. The blended hypocrisy and malice of this sally show the man.
Johnson knew, at times, how to coax without sincerity as well as to abuse without
justice. His seeming fondness for Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; of Lichfield, on his visits to that
City, and the contempt with which he spoke of her to her Townspeople, was
another instance of the same nature.

Genius perpetually criticized in our public Prints: “Passion has not sufficient
coolness to pause for metaphor, nor has metaphor ardor enough to keep pace
with passion.”&mdash;Nothing can be less true. Metaphoric strength of expression
will burst even from vulgar and illiterate minds when they are agitated. It is a
natural effort of roused sensibility in every gradation, from unlettered simplicity to
the highest refinement. Passion has no occasion to <i>pause</i> for metaphors, they <i>rush</i>
upon the mind which it has heated. Similies, it is true, are not natural to strong
emotion. <i>They</i> are the result of spirits that are calm, and at leisure to <i>compare</i>.

PREFACE.
</h3>
<p>
Translations scrupulously faithful are apt to be stiff,
vapid and obscure, from the often irreconcilably different nature
of languages, from local customs, and from allusions to circumstances
over which time has drawn a veil. In attempting to put
the most admired and interesting of Horace's Odes into English
Verse, I have taken only the Poet's general idea, frequently
expanding it, to elucidate the sense, and to bring the images more
distinctly to the eye; induced by the hope of thus infusing into
these Paraphrases the spirit of original composition. Neither have
I scrupled to follow the example of Dryden and Pope, by sometimes
adding ideas and imagery congenial to the subject, and
thus to translate Horace like a Poet, rather than a Versifier.
</p>
<p>
The trust, whether partial or not, that it was in my power <i>so</i>
to paraphrase the Odes of Horace, prompted the late Mr. Grove
of Lichfield, and the late Mr. Dewes of Wellsburn in Warwickshire,
to request that I would undertake the task respecting those
whose subjects best pleased me. Not acquainted with each other,
the coincidence of their opinion and request was flattering. They
were extensively known to be Gentlemen of distinguished virtues,
much classic erudition, and poetic taste;
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
“Blest with each talent, and each art to please,<br />
And born to write, converse, and live at ease.”<br />
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Dewes was the highly esteemed Friend of Dr. Parr, Mr.
Grove of Lord Sheffield. A beautiful epitaph in verse, written
by Mr. Grove, on his beloved Wife, is one of the chief ornaments
of Lichfield Cathedral.
</p>
<p>
The imitation of the Ode to Delius, applied to Mr. Erskine,
was written since the lamented death of those Gentlemen, which
happened in the meridian of their days. All the other Paraphrases
had been submitted to their revision and correction, and had
been honoured by their warm praise. That consciousness makes
me indifferent to the expected cavils of illiberal criticism.
</p>
<p>
Men of letters have often observed to me, that in paraphrasing
Horace, my sex would be an unpardonable crime with every
Pedant, whether within, or without the pale of professional
criticism. It is not in their power to speak or write more contemptuously
of my Horatian Odes than the Critics of Dryden's
and Pope's time, in the literary journals of that Period, wrote
of their Translations from Homer, Virgil, Horace, Boccace, and
Chaucer. Instances of that <i>public abuse</i> are triumphantly inserted
by Warburton in his Edition of Pope's works. See Appendix
to the Dunciad. It is re-published there, to justify some of the
personal severities of Pope's celebrated Satire.
</p>
<p>
Most of the notes to the ensuing Paraphrases are addressed to
their unlearned Readers, since no allusion can interest which is
not perfectly comprehended.

judicious emendation of the late Bishop of Chichester, who for <i>Me doctarum</i>,

to Augustus, who received him with kind respect. However he revolted from
him, persuaded by the Friends of Marc Antony, that the Battle of Actium would
decree the Empire to that General. The event, so contrary, brought Munatius
back to the feet of Augustus, but he was not received with former kindness, nor
did he deserve it, and retired, chagrined, to his fine seat at Tivoli, in the wood of
Tiburnus, so called from the neighbouring city, Tibur. There also, and near the
falls of Tivoli, described at full in Mr. Gray's letters, Horace had a villa. The
Poet, perceiving the spirits of Munatius dejected, writes this Ode to reconcile him
to his destiny, and to inspire him with delight in the beautiful Scenery by which
he was surrounded; insinuating, that should Augustus <i>banish</i> him, which was no
improbable event, he ought not to despond, but to form his conduct upon the
spirited example of Teucer; who, together with his Friends and Followers, was
banished from his native City, Salamis, by his Father, because he had not revenged
upon the Greeks the death of his Brother Ajax.&mdash;The disinterested design of this
Ode, and the humane attention it pays to a disgraced Nobleman, are much to the
Poet's honor, who was perhaps, in general, more disposed to gratulate the
Powerful, than to sooth the Unfortunate.

mention made of him by Horace, in his Tenth Satire, Book the First.
Valgius, like Sir Brooke Boothby, in these days, had poured forth a train of
elegiac Sorrows over the blight of his filial hopes. Horace does not severely
reprove these woes, he only wishes they may not be eternal, and that he will, at

the splendid victories, which Augustus had obtained in the East, were recent.

<a name="footnote_35_1"></a><a href="#ref_35_1">1</a>: Licinius Murena was a Patrician of high rank, one of the Brothers of
Proculeius, whose fraternal generosity is celebrated in the Ode to Sallust, the
ninth of these Paraphrases. The property of Licinius had been confiscated for
having borne arms against the second Triumvirate. Upon this confiscation Proculeius
divided two thirds of that large fortune, with which the Emperor had rewarded
his valor and fidelity in the royal cause, between Licinius, and his
adopted Brother, Terentius, whose fortunes had suffered equal wreck on account
of the Party he had taken. Horace wrote this Ode soon after the affectionate
bounty of Proculeius had restored his Friend to affluence. It breathes a warning
spirit towards that turbulent, and ambitious temper, which Horace perceived in
this young Nobleman. The Poet, however, has used great address and delicacy,
making the reflections not particular but general; and he guards against exciting
the soreness People feel from reprehension for their prevailing fault, by censuring
with equal freedom the opposite extreme. That kind caution insinuated in this
Ode, proved eventually vain, as did also the generosity of the Emperor, who soon
after permitted Licinius to be chosen Augur;&mdash;probably at the intercession of his
Favorite Mæcenas, who had married Terentia, a Daughter of that House, and
whom Horace calls Licinia in the Ode which is next paraphrased. Upon the
election of Licinius to this post of honor, trust, and dignity, we perceive the
spirits of Horace greatly elevated; probably as much from the pleasure he knew
Mæcenas would take in the promotion of his Brother-in-law, as from the attachment
himself bore to Licinius. A peculiar air of hilarity shines out in the Ode
addressed to Telephus, written the evening on which this Licinius, then newly
chosen Augur, gave his first supper to his Friends. The Reader will find it somewhat
lavishly paraphrased in the course of this Selection. By the <i>above</i> Ode the
Poet seems to have feared the seditious disposition of Licinius:&mdash;but when he
afterwards strung his lyre to notes of triumph for the honors of his Friend, he
little imagined <i>that</i> Friend would finally suffer death for ungratefully conspiring
against the Monarch, who had so liberally overlooked his former enmity.

<p>
<a name="footnote_36_1"></a><a href="#ref_36_1">1</a>: Of that artful caution, which marks the character of Horace, this Ode
forms a striking instance. He declines the task appointed by his Patron, that of
describing the Italian Wars, because he foresees that in its execution he must either
disoblige the Emperor, and his Minister, by speaking too favorably of their Enemies,
or offend some Friends, whom he yet retained amongst those, who had
exerted themselves against the Cæsars. Horace endeavours to soften the effect of
this non-compliance by a warm panegyric upon Licinia, the betrothed bride of
Mæcenas. She is in other places called Terentia. Both these names have affinity
to those of her Brothers, Licinius, afterwards Augur, and her adopted Brother,
Terentius.
</p>
<p>
Horace mentions <i>plainly</i> the Numantian Wars, and those with Hannibal, but
artfully speaks of those of Brutus, and Cassius, and of the Character of Antony,
under <i>fabulous</i> denomination, sufficiently understood by Augustus, and his
Minister. Dacier justly observes how easy it is to discern, that by the Lapithæ,
and Giants, defeated by Hercules on the plains of Thessaly, the Poet means the
Armies of Brutus, and Cassius, defeated by Augustus, almost in the same place,
at the Battle of Philippi. He concludes also that by Hylæus is meant Mark
Antony, who assumed the name of Bacchus, and ruined himself by his profligate
passion for Cleopatra. Another Commentator observes, that as the Giants, and
Lapithæ, are said to have made the Palace of Saturn shake, so also did Brutus, and
Cassius, and afterwards Mark Antony, make all Italy tremble, and that it is
Rome itself that Horace would have to be understood by the <i>magnificent Palace of
Saturn</i>. Some Critics seek to destroy all the common sense, beauty, and character
of this Ode, by denying the allegoric interpretation; and also by insisting
that Licinia was the Poet's <i>own</i> Mistress, and not the mistress of his Patron. It
had been absurd, and inconceivably unmeaning, if, when he was requested to
sing the triumphs of Augustus in the Italian Wars, he should, during the brief
mention of them, have adverted to old fables, uniting them, not as a simile, but
in a line of continuation with the Numantian, and Carthaginian Wars; unless,
beneath those fables, he shadowed forth the <i>Roman</i> Enemies of Augustus.
</p>
<p>
The idea that Licinia was the Mistress of Horace, has surely little foundation:&mdash;for
it were strange indeed if he could take pleasure in describing amorous familiarities
between Mæcenas, and the Person with whom <i>himself</i> was in love. One
of these Critics alledges, as the reason why this Lady could <i>not</i> be the destined
Bride of <i>Mæcenas</i>, that it would have been as indiscreet in <i>him</i> to have admitted
Horace to be a witness of his passion for Licinia-Terentia, as it would have been
impertinent in the <i>Poet</i>, to have invaded the privacies of his Patron. It is not
necessary, from this Ode, to conclude that Horace had <i>witnessed</i> the tender scene
he describes. He might, without any hazard of imputed impertinence, venture
to paint, from his imagination, the innocently playful endearments of betrothed
Lovers. The picture was much more likely to <i>flatter</i> than to <i>disgust</i> the gay, and
gallant Mæcenas.

<a name="footnote_38_1"></a><a href="#ref_38_1">1</a>: At the feast, held in honor of Licinius Murena having been chosen Augur,
Horace endeavours to turn the conversation towards gayer subjects than Grecian
Chronology, and the Trojan War, upon which his Friend Telephus had been declaiming;
and for this purpose seems to have composed the ensuing Ode at table.
It concludes with an hint, that the unpleasant state of the Poet's mind, respecting
his <i>then</i> Mistress, incapacitates him for abstracted themes, which demand a serene
and collected attention, alike inconsistent with the amorous discontent of the secret
heart, and with the temporary exhilaration of the spirits, produced by the occasion
on which they were met. This must surely be the meaning of Horace in this
Ode, however obscurely expressed. People of sense do not, even in their gayest
conversation, start from their subject to another of <i>total</i> inconnexion. When
the latent meaning in the <i>concluding</i> verses is perspicuously paraphrased, it accounts
for the Poet's preference at <i>that</i> period, of trifling to literary subjects. These
slight, and often obscure allusions, closely, and what is called <i>faithfully</i> translated,
give a wild and unmeaning air to the Odes of Horace, which destroys their interest
with the <i>unlearned</i> admirers of Poetry. To give distinct shape and form to
these embryo ideas, often capable of acquiring very <i>interesting</i> form and shape,

<p>
<a name="footnote_41_1"></a><a href="#ref_41_1">1</a>: The Reader will remember, that in the course of these Paraphrases the design
has been <i>avowed</i> of stretching the pictures of Horace upon a <i>wider</i> canvass, of
filling up what are so often mere outlines. If learned eyes ever glance over this
Ode, it is hoped they will not <i>frown</i> upon the many circumstances and reflections
which have been <i>added</i>, upon a presumption, induced by the pleasing nature of
the subject, since the Roman customs and manners are preserved with fidelity.
Those customs and manners, resulting from their festal, gay, and picturesque
Religion, cannot surely be presented without proving interesting. Yet, to <i>create</i> this
interest, <i>stronger</i> and more <i>circumstantial</i> description seems required than can be found
in Horace, if the Paraphraser may be allowed to judge of the poetic feelings of
others by her own. It was doubtless sufficient for his contemporary Readers, and
for those of some succeeding Generations, that he slightly alluded to events and
ceremonies, which were familiar to <i>their</i> recollection. In <i>our</i> day more precision
is demanded, at least by those who have poetic taste without knowledge of the
dead languages, or intimacy with the national and domestic customs of that
Time, and of that People. Also, to strengthen this necessary interest in the
mind of the Reader, it must be eligible to infuse a more liberal portion of those
sentiments and ideas, which speak to the Heart in <i>every</i> Age, and in every
Climate.
</p>
<p>
To <i>Scholars</i> the fascinating music of the Latin tones and measures, and the
elegance with which Horace knew to select, and to regulate them, recompense the
obscurity which is so frequent in his allusions, and in the violence of his transitions
from one subject to another, between which the line of connexion is with
difficulty traced. What is called a <i>faithful</i> translation of these Odes cannot,
therefore, be interesting to <i>unlearned</i> Lovers of Verse, how alive soever they may
be to <i>poetic beauty</i>.&mdash;A literal translation in the plainest prose, will always shew
the precise quantity of real poetic matter, contained in <i>any</i> Production, independent
of the music of its intonation, and numbers, and the elegance of its
style.&mdash;The prose translations of Horace' Odes evince that their merit does not
consist in the <i>plenitude</i> of poetic matter, or essence, constituted by circumstances
of startling interest, by exalted sentiment, impassioned complaint, or appeal,
distinct and living imagery, happy apposite allusion, and sublime metaphor; but
in certain elegant verbal felicities and general charm of style, produced by the
force and sweetness of the Latin Language, subservient to the fine ear, the lively
and exquisite taste of Horace. These are the graces which we find so apt to
<i>evaporate</i> in Translation, while genuine <span class="allsmcap">POETIC MATTER</span>, as defined above, is
capable of being transfused into any other Language without losing a <i>particle</i> of
its excellence, provided the Chemist, who undertakes the operation, has genius
and skill. The more this <span class="allsmcap">POETIC MATTER</span> in an Author abounds, the more
close and faithful a Translator, who has judgment, may venture to render his
version&mdash;but to transfuse merely <i>verbal</i> felicities into another Language is an attempt
scarcely less fruitless than to clasp the Rainbow. A kindred <i>nothingness</i>, as
to poetic <i>value</i>, ensues. There <i>is</i>, however, a considerable, though not <i>abounding</i>
quantity of poetic matter, or essence in Horace; but it bears no proportion to the
profusion of those evanescent glories, which will not bear the grasp of another
Language. To give that essence in increased quantity, and in the freedom of
unimitative numbers, is attempted in this selection. Dryden and Pope translated
upon that plan, and hence their Paraphrases have the spirit of original Poems.
</p>
<p>
Ere this note closes, its Author desires to observe, that Painters cannot take
a striking likeness of a face, in which there is no <i>predominant</i> feature, and the
Poet can only make his image, or description, distinct, animated, and forcible,
by bringing forward some characteristic trait of the object he is presenting.
</p>
<p>
When Horace says in this Ode, “How pleasing is it to see the well-fed sheep
hastening home,” the observation is not <i>picturesque</i>, and therefore does not
strongly impress the Imagination; but when he adds&mdash;“to see the <i>weary Oxen
dragging, with languid neck, the inverted Ploughshare</i>,” he gives perhaps the most
poetic feature in this Ode. Had he only said, “to see the Oxen returning
from their labor,” his Oxen had been as much without character as his Sheep,
and the sentence must have passed unimpressive over the mind of the Reader.
It is the words&mdash;<i>dragging, with languid</i> neck, the inverted ploughshare, that
makes the sentence <i>Poetry</i>, and empowers it to arrest and charm the fancy.
Had Horace always written thus, undeviating fidelity had been the best aim of his
Translator, and the sure way of rendering him delightful in every Language.
